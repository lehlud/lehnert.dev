<h1>Test: First Blog Entry</h1>
<h2>April 15th, 2025</h2>

<p><u>Hello</u> to whoever is reading this!</p>

<p>This blog entry is mainly for testing purposes.</p>

<p>Here's a <a href="https://google.com/">link</a> to Google, try clicking on it!</p>

<p>
    If you haven't noticed so already, this blog is heavily inspired by
    <a href="https://handwritten.blog/">handwritten.blog</a>.
    I've discovered Daniel's blog last week and almost instantly thought about how I
    could create my own handwritten blog. I don't know if Daniel will ever read this,
    but if you do, please keep up the work, I am a fan!
</p>

<p>
    And just like Daniel, I will only accept comments that have been written by hand
    and mailed to <a href="blog@lehnert.dev">blog@lehnert.dev</a>.
</p>

<p>
    But unlike handwritten.blog, this blog is brought to you by Simple Vector Graphics
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">SVG</a>)s
    instead of Portable Network Graphics
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG">PNG</a>)s.
    This comes at the disadvantage of bigger file sizes (currently, this blog entry
    weighs in at 25 MB without optimizations and still 1.8 MB when optimized using
    <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> on default settings). However, I am
    convinced (and optimistic) to further reduce the size of handwritten SVGs in the
    future.
